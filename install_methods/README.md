# Install Methods

## Methods

These are a few ways you can follow along with this video series.

- [First method](./00/) - this is probably the easiest for people that are new
- [Second method](./01/) - this is still decently easy, just involves a bit of cli work
- [Third method](./02/) - this is only if you are fairly aquainted with docker and/or vagrant

## Note

If you choose either the first or second method you will get some additional niceties that I have baked into the virtual machine's (vm's) setup through bash aliases.
